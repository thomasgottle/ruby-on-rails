# Getting started with Rails

## 1
### Getting up and running with Ruby on Rails.

By creating this repository, I worked through and applied the core building blocks of a modern Rails application:

* Installed Ruby on Rails, initialized a fresh app, and set up a working database connection.
* Got familiar with the overall structure and conventions of a Rails project.
* Learned the fundamentals of MVC (Model, View, Controller) architecture and RESTful design patterns.
* Used Rails generators to scaffold the initial components of the app efficiently.
* Deployed the finished application to production using Kamal.
